<h3>Step 2 of 3: What does your data look like?</h3>
  <table class="table">

      <td> 
        <p>1.	Each dataset was generated from a single sample and donor (e.g. whole brain imaging) on the same instrument.
      Multiple datasets can be accommodated in a single submission. The lines of the specimen tab in the metadata spreadsheet must match exactly to the lines in the dataset tab (i.e. the specimen listed in specimen tab row 5 is the specimen for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab. 
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <input type="radio" id="ingest_method" name="ingest_method" value="ingest_2">
      </td>
      <td> 
        <p>2.	The dataset was generated from multiple samples, specimens, or donors on the same instrument.
      Only a single dataset can be accommodated per submission. Multiple specimens should be listed in the metadata spreadsheet, but only a single dataset. There should be one line in the image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab.       
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <input type="radio" id="ingest_method" name="ingest_method" value="ingest_3">
      </td>
      <td> 
        <p>3.	All datasets were generated from one specimen, but are from unique regions of interest on the specimen. 
      Multiple datasets can be accommodated in a single submission. List the specimen multiple times in the specimen tab. Identify the specific region of interest in the locations column. Multiple donor lines must match exactly in the metadata spreadsheet (i.e. the specimen listed in specimen tab row 5 is the specimen for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab.       
        </p>

      </td>
      <td> 
      <p>4.	All datasets were generated from one specimen â€“ but use different experimental (machinery) parameters.  
      Multiple datasets can be accommodated as a single submission. There should be exactly one entry in the specimen tab. The lines listed in the Instrument tab in the metadata spreadsheet must match exactly to the lines in the dataset tab (i.e. the instrument listed in instrument tab row 5 is the instrument  for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab.
