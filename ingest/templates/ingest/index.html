<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Brain Image Library (BIL) is a national public resource enabling
researchers to deposit, analyze, mine, share and interact with large brain
image datasets.
The BIL is supported by the National
Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes
of Health under award number R24MH114793.
</p>

<h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>
A dataset is a stand-alone entry (e.g. an image-volume) with metadata. 
A dataset can contain many 2D image files that may be assembled to 
form a more complex two or three-dimensional volume. Datasets are 
defined on disk by their “root” directory in which all the image files 
for the dataset are contained (the root directory can contain 
recursive subdirectories that contain image files).
</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>
A collection bundle is an ingestion wrapper that contains one or more 
related datasets and metadata.  Collections are tagged with 
identifying metadata (such as the NIH project that the data is 
associated with) that upon submission will be propagated to each item 
in the collection. This important tagging information will allow BIL 
to report to NIH on data that has begun, but has not yet completed the 
submission process. In general, smaller collection bundles are 
recommended because all datasets within a collection must pass the 
validation process for the collection bundle to be accepted.
